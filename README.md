# Machine Learning and Deep Learning [ASSIGNMENT]

## Number 1 Machine Learning - Classification with Supervised Machine Learning Models (Supervised: Classification)

Case Description:

Predicting the Churn Status in Banking. Where, participants were able to classify fraud transactions using **Multilayer Perceptron**.

TODO:
- Complete the code provided, so that you'll have three different models.
- Compare the three models, and summarize which model is the best (and why, giving reasons).
- Use model optimization methods where necessary (such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, etc.).

## Number 2 Machine Learning - Data Segmentation with KMeans Clustering (Unsupervised: Clustering)

Case Description:

Determining the Best Number of Clusters from Random Data Points. Where, participants were able to compare the classification accuracy of **various supervised learning** models by utilizing libraries from _Pandas_, _Numpy_, _Scikit-learn_, _Matplotlib_, _Seaborn_.

TODO:
- Complete the code provided.
- Summarize how many clusters are best for the given data.
- Visualize the successfully created clusters.

## Number 3 Deep Learning - Predict House Pricing with Dual Input Settings using Multilayer Perceptron (Supervised: Regression)

Case Description : 

Where, participants were able to predict house prices using **Multilayer Perceptron** by utilizing _Pandas_, _Numpy_, _Scikit-learn_, and _Matplotlib_ libraries along with the _**Tensorflow-Keras**_ Framework.

TODO:
- Complete the code provided.
- Answer [QUESTION] directly on the notebook, if any.
- Enable T4 GPU in Google Colab, if instructed.

## Number 4 Deep Learning - Classify Credit Fraud Transactions using Multilayer Perceptron (Supervised: Classification)

Case Description : 

Where, participants were able to classify fraud transactions using **Multilayer Perceptron** by utilizing _Pandas/cuDF_, _Scikit-learn/cuML_, _Numpy/cuPy_ libraries along with _**PyTorch**_ framework. 

TODO :
- Complete the code provided.
- Answer [QUESTION] directly on the notebook, if any.
- Enable T4 GPU in Google Colab, if instructed.
- Ensure that the model evaluation result (with test data) is above 95%.
